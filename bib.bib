	abstract = {This document provides guidance on how to secure operational
                technology ({OT}) while addressing their unique performance, reliability, and safety
                requirements. {OT} encompasses a broad range of programmable systems and devices that
                interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the
                physical environment). These systems and devices detect or cause a direct change
                through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and events. Examples
                include industrial control systems, building automation systems, transportation
                systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring systems,
                and physical environment measurement systems. The document provides an overview of
                {OT} and typical system topologies, identifies common threats and vulnerabilities to
                these systems, and provides recommended security countermeasures to mitigate the
                associated risks.},

	abstract = {Network convergence is an increasing trend in the automation domain. More and more plant owners strive for a unification of networks in their plants. This yields a seamless network structure, simplified supervision, and reduced training effort for the personnel, as only one unified network technology needs to be handled. Ethernet-{APL} is one piece of the puzzle for such a converged network, supporting various real time protocols like {PROFINET}, {EtherNet}, {HART}-{IP} as well as the middleware protocol {OPC} {UA}. This paper gives an overview on the impact of Ethernet-{APL} field devices to {OT} security and proposes how to ensure {OT} security for them.},

	abstract = {The {PROFINET} protocol has been expanded in the current version to include security functions. This allows flexible network architectures with the consideration of {OT} security requirements to be designed for {PROFINET}, which were not possible due to the network segmentation previously required. In addition to the manufacturers of the protocol stacks, component manufacturers are also required to implement a secure implementation in their devices. The necessary measures go beyond the use of a secure protocol stack. Using the example of an Ethernet-{APL} transmitter with {PROFINET} communication, this article shows which technical and organizational framework conditions will have to be considered by {PROFINET} device manufacturers in the future.},
